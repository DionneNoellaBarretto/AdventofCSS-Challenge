# Brief

In this project, we're creating a rock, paper, scissors game.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

## Users should be able to:

- Select rock, paper, or scissors
- On a second page, they should see "you win" or the "computer wins." This page should also display the choices that the user and computer made, as well as, a button to play again.

## Need some support on this challenge?

2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's README.md file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Animate the elements loading onto the page
- Animate the page transition, showing who won.
