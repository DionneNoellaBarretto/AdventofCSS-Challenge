# Brief

In this project, we're going to create Password Generator

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- See a form input for displaying a generated password
- A copy button should appear to the right of the input field. When the user clicks on the copy button, the word “Copied” should appear. _NOTE: Showing and hiding the “copied” text can only be achieved within JavaScript. However, we will be creating all of the elements needed to be able to do this within JavaScript_
- Range slider for selecting the number of characters. The number of characters should be displayed next to the slider.
- Checkboxes for the following
  - Include Symbols (@#$%)
  - Include Numbers (1234)
  - Include Lowercase Characters (abcd)
  - Include Uppercase Characters (ABCD)
  - Exclude Similar Characters (i, l, 1, L, o, O, 0)

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add an additional checkbox for excluding ambiguous characters { } ( ) / \ ' " ` ~ , ; : . < >
- Try adding interactivity to this challenge with JavaScript. If you get stuck, be sure to check out the [Advent of JavaScript.](http://adventofjavascript.com)
