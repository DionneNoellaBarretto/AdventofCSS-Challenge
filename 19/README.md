# Brief

In this project, we're going to create sign-up form with validation.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- Users should be able to enter
  - a name (text)
  - an email address (email address)
  - a password (password)
  - confirm their password (password)
- When the user focuses on the text field, the label should move (within CSS)
- Display a toggle button for showing and hiding the password
- Display an error message to the right of the input field.
- Display a success check to the right of the input field.

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add additional form fields. Including a custom checkbox or a custom radio button.
- Try adding interactivity to the form with JavaScript. If you get stuck, be sure to check out the [Advent of JavaScript](http://adventofjavascript.com).
