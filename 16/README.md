# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a star rating.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- See five star outlines
- When the user hovers over the first star, it changes into a solid star
- When the user hovers over the second star, it shows the first and second star as a solid star.
- When the user hovers over the third star, it shows the first, second, and third star as a solid star.
- When the user hovers over the fourth star, it shows the first, second, third, and fourth star as a solid star.
- When the user hovers over the fifth star, it shows the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth star as a solid star.

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- This challenge can be achieved in multiple ways. Try finding another way to solve this challenge.
  - For example, one way this challenge can be solved is with JavaScript. Be sure to check out the [Advent of JavaScript](http://adventofjavascript.com), where James explains how to solve this with JavaScript.
