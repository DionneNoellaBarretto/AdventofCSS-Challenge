# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a weather forecast.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- Display the weather forecast.

# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file (within the appropriate section of Podia). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file and/or the source HTML and CSS files. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's README.md file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, or CSS Modules. Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Animate the elements and components in or on hover.
