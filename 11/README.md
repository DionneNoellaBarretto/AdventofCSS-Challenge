# Brief

In this project, we're going to create expanding and collapsing sections

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- Set a class to display the collapsed or expanded section

# Need some support on this challenge?

- Upgrade to the [Solution Tier](http://adventofcss.com). You'll get a video explanation from Amy.
- Join the [Learn Build Teach Discord community](http://learnbuildteach.com). We have a separate channel set up specifically for the Advent of JavaScript.

# Getting Started

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add interactivity to the FAQ element by adding JavaScript. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the [Advent of JavaScript](http://adventofjavascript.com) solutions, where James explains exactly how to build this.
