# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a custom modal

<IMAGE>

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- Click on a point on the image, that triggers the modal
- Click on the x within the modal to close the modal

# Getting Started

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add additional points to the image with their own custom modals.
- Animate the modal in and out
