# Brief

In this project, we're going to create the YoUTube individual video page layout.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- See a Featured Video as a video embed from YouTube, with its corresponding title and description
- A sidebar with additional videos. These videos will show a thumbnail and corresponding title. Each thumbnail will link to that specific video on YouTube.
- The featured video and the sidebar of video thumbnails should scroll independently of each other.

# Need some support on this challenge?

- Upgrade to the [Solution Tier](http://adventofcss.com). You'll get a video explanation from Amy.
- Join the [Learn Build Teach Discord](http://learnbuildteach.com) community. We have a separate channel set up specifically for the Advent of JavaScript.

# Getting Started

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Create a section for commenting on the featured video
- Add additional navigation to the header bar
- When the user scrolls down on the page, show the YouTube logo, as is. But, when the user scrolls up, either hide or reduce the size of the YouTube logo
