# **Brief**

In this project, we're going to create a computer keyboard.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# **Users should be able to:**

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling

**Need some support on this challenge?** Join the [Learn Build Teach](http://learnbuildteach.com) Discord community. We have a separate channel set up specifically for the Advent of CSS.

# **Taking your Project to the Next Level**

- Use a framework or library like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Time the user to see how many successful key presses they can get within a given amount of time.
