# **Getting Started**

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file (that's this!). It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!

6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or library like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add some animation
- Add a toggle to show monthly vs annual pricing
