# Brief

In this project, we're creating a keyboard. I love this project because at first glance it seems easy, but there are some more complicated steps involved.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- See the keyboard centered on the page
- Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors
  - White keys will change to yellow `#ffd200`
  - Black keys will change to pink `#f40082`

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or library like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Add interactivity to this project with JavaScript. Each key you tap will play a different audio clip. You can get all the audio clips for free by signing up to the Advent of JavaScript for free. Of course, if you get stuck, you can always purchase the [solutions](http://adventofjs.com), where James explains how to build it.
